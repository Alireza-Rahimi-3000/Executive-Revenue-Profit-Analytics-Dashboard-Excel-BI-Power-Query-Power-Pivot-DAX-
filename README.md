# 📊 Executive Revenue & Profit Analytics Dashboard

**Excel BI Project | Power Query • Power Pivot • DAX • Data Modeling**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a fully interactive Revenue & Profit Analytics Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel using a structured Business Intelligence approach. The objective was to transform raw transactional data into a scalable, model-driven reporting system capable of supporting executive-level financial and operational decision-making.

The dashboard analyzes 24K+ transactions and delivers insights across revenue performance, profitability, cost structure, time trends, country segmentation, and weekday contribution.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

The dashboard was designed to answer key performance questions:

* What is the overall revenue, profit, COGS, and margin performance?
* How do quarterly results compare in terms of contribution to total profit?
* Which weekdays drive the highest profitability?
* What percentage of revenue comes from highlighted years?
* How does performance vary across countries?
* How are transactions evolving over time?

## 🏗 Data Architecture & Modeling

The project follows a structured BI workflow:

### 1️⃣ Data Transformation (Power Query)

* Cleaned and standardized transactional dataset
* Handled missing values and formatted date columns
* Created structured tables ready for modeling
* Optimized data types for performance

### 2️⃣ Data Modeling (Power Pivot)

* Built relational data model
* Established relationships between fact and dimension tables
* Applied star-schema principles for scalable reporting
* Ensured correct filter propagation

### 3️⃣ DAX Measures & KPIs

Created dynamic measures including:

* Total Revenue
* Total COGS
* Total Profit
* Profit Margin %
* Transaction Count
* Quarterly Profit Contribution %
* Weekday vs Weekend Profit %
* Year-based revenue contribution
* Growth rate calculations

All KPIs update dynamically through slicer interactions.
